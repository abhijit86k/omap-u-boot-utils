{"name":"Omap-u-boot-utils","tagline":"U-Boot Utilities for Texas Instrument's OMAP platforms","body":"#Motivation\r\nTraditionally U-Boot has worked with terminal applications such as minicom/hyperterminal/ckermit etc. However,\r\n\r\nThese applications dont work out fine when we think of automating these as part of scripts or the like.\r\nMany corporations use a mixture of Operating Systems at work. Common applications functioning similarly accross host Operating Systems are sadly lacking.\r\nWith the bunch of utilities in this project, we hope to bridge these gaps. We can create wrappers on top of these utilities, allowing us to potentially have scripted interfaces or even GUI, or IDE integration!\r\n\r\n#Hosting Notes\r\nOMAP-U-Boot-Utils is now hosted entirely in github:\r\n\r\nSource Code hosting: Git Hub http://github.com/nmenon/omap-u-boot-utils/\r\n\r\nAccess Source Code\r\nConsidering that most U-Boot and Linux kernel developers are git users, the source is hosted at github. There are two access paths:\r\n\r\nhttp protocol - for folks behind restrictive firewalls: http://github.com/nmenon/omap-u-boot-utils.git\r\ngit protocol: git://github.com/nmenon/omap-u-boot-utils.git\r\nTo get a copy of the code, it is as simple as:\r\ngit-clone git/http link\r\nNOTE:\r\n\r\nUsers with proxy need to remember to setup their http_proxy variable. Here is more information: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1575\r\nMore on using Git: http://github.com/guides/home\r\nOperating Systems Supported\r\nThe targetted Operating Systems to be supported by this are:\r\n\r\n* Linux\r\n* Windows\r\n* Mac OS X\r\nNOTE: Not all O/S are functioning at the moment for all applications. documentation has further information\r\nHow to Discuss/ Send Patches for OMAP U-Boot Utils\r\nThere is no specific mailing list setup at the moment - but send a patch to http://groups.google.com/group/beagleboard with subject OMAP-U-Boot-Utils and I will pick it up..\r\n\r\nCoding style is Linux kernel coding style, and do run checkpatch.pl and Lindent to indent the file.. See http://lxr.linux.no/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle for more details\r\n\r\nHappy Hunting..","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
